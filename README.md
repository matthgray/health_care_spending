Analysis of health care spending by disease
Executive Summary
Create a presentation that shows key statistics from bea.gov website, and an understanding of how prices work in healthcare. The app allows the user to select a disease. The output will show the cost of that disease from 2007 to 2017.
Motivation
What has happened to the cost of mental health since 2012? What makes prices different in health care than other markets? 
Data Question
What health issue has seen the biggest increase in spending since 2007 in the U.S.A.?  What is the average, min, max, median, STD of spending over the years overall and for each disease. What is the role of prices in healthcare? What are some ways of spending less on healthcare?
Data Sources


# Inspiration
The idea is to do a descriptive analysis on health care expenditure by disease in the United States from 2000 to 2017. This can help health insurance companies negotiate prices for coverage with hospitals. Also, entrepreneur's could use this to see demand for products or services in certain markets in health care.
## Key Questions:
* Which disease has increased consistently over 17 years?
* What is the average spending for diseases?

# Data Selection
I'm using data from https://www.bea.gov/data/special-topics/health-care to analyze this
