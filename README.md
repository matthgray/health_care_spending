Analysis of health care spending by disease
Executive Summary
Create a presentation that shows key statistics from bea.gov website, and an understanding of how prices work in healthcare. The app allows the user to select a disease. The output will show the cost of that disease from 2007 to 2017.
Motivation
What has happened to the cost of mental health since 2012? What makes prices different in health care than other markets? 



# Inspiration
The idea is to create a descriptive analysis application on health care expenditure by disease in the United States from 2000 to 2017. This can help health insurance companies negotiate prices for coverage with hospitals. Also, entrepreneur's could use this to see demand for products or services in certain markets in health care.
## Key Questions:
* What is the average growth rate for a disease?
* What is the average spending for a diseases?
* What is the max spending for a disease?
* What is the minimun spending for a disease?

# Data Selection
I'm using data from https://www.bea.gov/data/special-topics/health-care to analyze this

# Cleaning
The data needed some row removed and a transfer from wide to tall.

# Visualization
The application creates two graphs. One is a bar graph. The other is a dot graph with a regression line.

# Storytelling
The short answer is healthcare spending is complicated. The way individuals purchase healthcare is complicated. The interaction between insurance buyers and companies is complicated. The interaction between hospitals and insurance companies is complicated. The laws passed that influence those complicated interactions are complicated.
## There are three books that help with this complication:
